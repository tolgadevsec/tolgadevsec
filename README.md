### Hi there, I'm Tolga! 👋

I'm a web developer and PhD candidate at the [Abertay University](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/tolga-%C3%BCnl%C3%BC) where I research intrusion detection and response techniques for web applications. I'm also exploring the use of deception technology for application defense.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tolgauedev) to stay up-to-date on recent projects and developments in my research area.
