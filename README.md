### Hi there, I'm Tolga! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD graduate from the [Abertay University](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/tolga-%C3%BCnl%C3%BC) where I investigated attack-aware web applications. As part of my research, I have collected repositories of projects, proof of concepts and research work related to application intrusion detection, deception and defence-in-depth mechanisms which you can find here and which I will keep maintaining.
