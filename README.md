### Hi there, I'm Tolga! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and PhD candidate at the [Abertay University](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/tolga-%C3%BCnl%C3%BC) where I research intrusion detection and response techniques for web applications. I'm also exploring the use of deception for application defense.
