### Hi there, I'm Tolga! 👋

I'm a PhD graduate from the [Abertay University](https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/tolga-%C3%BCnl%C3%BC) where I investigated **_attack-aware_** web applications. As part of [my research](https://tolgadevsec.github.io/), I have collected repositories of projects, proof of concepts and research work related to application intrusion detection, deception and defence-in-depth mechanisms which you can find here. 

I enjoy researching the intersection of software development and security (`DevSec`), in particular the following areas:
- ⚔️ Attack-Aware & Defendable Software Development 
- 🎛️ Security Unit Testing
- 🌱 Software Resilience

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tolgadevsec) or [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@canario).
